## Background
I had been develop some Apps about math to solve some problems, and they are useful.
But, I found the problem.
All of the App has strong coupling that I can't fix some bugs as well that it need to re-install.
So, I decide to develop an App, different to before
It should has many cards(plugins) for download, the cards(plugins) should update on time, that I can fix some bugs as fast, and provide some new features for users.
And, this is that App.
## Install
It's easy. Be sure you has a Android system, and its version **must higher than 4.0 (Api 14, IceCreamSandwich)**.
Download apk and install as usual.
## Usage
The App has many features, enjoy!
- Add cards
	- From card store
	- From local file
You can find them on a magic "+" button (Hua ji)

After you add a card, you can use it.
Click the card to open it

And you can do that, if you want:
- Check update for cards
	Long click card, you can find it.
- Delete cards
	Long click, you know <=

Need more help?
You can try "Help"
You can find it on sidemenu

Enjoy all features in app! <=
